# Adding your icon

Create a version of your icon in 32x32 / 64x64 / 128x128 pixels, add to their respective folders and create a pull request. If have the file in svg format, call it whatever and slap it into the SVG directory. Add the original un-resized file to original if you have one.

Alternatively open an issue with links to an icon in at least 128x128 and I'll resize them for you.
