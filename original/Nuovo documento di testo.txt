Hi, we are evaluating the feasibility of a project that includes a water park, the dimension we thought of is more or less the one of this park.
1. How much does this park cost?
2. How much does sending by sea cost?
3. Is it possible to change some elements?
4. What is the maximum size of a deflated item and the weight?
5. What is the average time to inflate an item and deflate it?
6. A repair kit is provided, what does it include and how much does it cost?
7. According to your experience, how much is the annual maintenance cost estimated?
8. One factor that worries us is the heating of the surface of the elements, spending a lot of time under the intense sun of the Caribbean.
As specified is a feasibility study so we need indicative numbers to make a first rough estimate, not the exact price
